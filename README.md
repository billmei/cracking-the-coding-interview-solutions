# Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition Solutions

My personal python solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview 6th edition by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

## Tips

Problem-solving flowchart:

1. Listen Carefully
  - Pay attention to how to problem is described
  - Ask assumptions, constraints, inputs, and outputs
  - The problem may not be at all related to one you've done before even if they sound similar!
2. Example
  - Try a typical case, special cases, large and small inputs, null inputs.
3. Black Box
  - State what are the simplest things required to get you to the solution, using black boxes along the way
4. BUD
  - Open those black boxes and state how they will be implemented
  - Look for Bottlenecks, Unnecessary, and Duplicated work to optimize
5. Walk through
  - Walk through the entire approach in detail before starting to code (annotate each step as comments in the function)
6. Implement
  - Code it!
  - Refactor, modularize, and cleanup
7. Test
  - Conceptual test. Walk through the code and execute manually
  - Try typical cases
  - Check arithmetic (off by one) and null nodes
  - Try edge cases
